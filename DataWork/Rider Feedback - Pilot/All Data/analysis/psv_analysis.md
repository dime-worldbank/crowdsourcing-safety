This document summarizes results from piloting the Matatu Rider Feedback project. So far, there have been 4 pilots:

__Pilot 1__

* __Number of Vehicles:__ 5
* __Start Date:__ March 27, 2020
* __Awards:__ None
* __QR/Shortcode On Sticker:__ Only QR
* __Other Details:__ Installed on long range Lothian buses

__Pilot 2__

* __Number of Vehicles:__ 15
* __Start Date:__ June 25, 2020
* __Awards:__ (1) 8 vehicles advertised that each user would get 200 KES after completing the survey; (2) 7 vehicles advertised that each user would get 100 KES after completing the survey. After an initial large response rate, the award was lowered to 50 KES. The stickers still advertised 100 and 200 KES; however, the survey notified the user that the award had been lowered.
* __QR/Shortcode On Sticker:__ Both
* __Other Details:__ 

__Pilot 3__

* __Number of Vehicles:__ 15
* __Start Date:__ July 29, 2020
* __Awards:__ (1) 9 vehicles advertised that riders would receive 50 KES after completing the survey; (2) 6 vehicles advertising that users could win 50 KES after completing the survey
* __QR/Shortcode On Sticker:__ (1) In 12 matatus, the stickers had both the shortcode and QR code; (2) in 3 matatus, the stickers just had the QR code.
* __Other Details:__



__Pilot 4__

* __Number of Vehicles:__ 21
* __Start Date:__ September 5, 2020
* __Awards:__ For all vehicles, stickers advertised that users could win 100 KES after completing the survey.
* __QR/Shortcode On Sticker:__ In 11 matatus, the stickers had both the shortcode and QR code; in 10 matatus the stickers just had the QR code.
* __Other Details:__ In the design of the sticker the QR code was made larger to make it easier to scan
