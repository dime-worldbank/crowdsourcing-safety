This document summarizes results from piloting the Matatu Rider Feedback project. So far, there have been 4 pilots:

* __Pilot 0__
* Stickers with just QR codes installed on 5 Lothian buses

* __Pilot 1__ 
* 15 Vehicles involved. 
* 8 vehicles had stickers advertising that riders receive 200 KES after completing the survey 
* 7 vehicles advertised receiving 100 KES after completing the survey.
* We received a large number of responses after only a couple days of running the pilot. Consequently, we lowered the award for types to 20 KES. The lower award was advertised in the survey. 
* In the shortcode, to identify the vehicle, users entered a 2 digit number that was put on the stickers. 
* The pilot started on June 28, and the stickers indicated that the award expired on July 20.

* __Pilot 2__ 
* 15 vehicles involved. 
* 9 vehicles had stickers advertising that riders received 50 KES after completing the survey (6 had both the shortcode and QR code, while 3 only had the QR code)  
* 6 vehicles advertised winning 50 KES in airtime. 
* Instead of a two digit number, the licence plate was put on the sticker and riders entered the plate number in the shortcode survey.
* As with the previous pilot, we received a large number of responses in the first couple days. We paused the shortcode survey where a rider automatically recieved the 50 KES award due to large costs. 
* On August 12, we restarted the survey -- only asking 3 questions and lowered the award to 10 KES.
* The stickers were installedon July 28 and the stickers indicate that the award offer expires on August 31.

* __Pilot 3__ 
* 20 vehicles involved
* 10 vehicles had both QR and shortcode, 10 only had QR
* Those giving feedback could win 100 KES. No expirtation date.
